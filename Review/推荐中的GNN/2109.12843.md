# Introduction

The history of recommender systems

- shallow models
- neural models
- GNN-based models

Advantages of GNNs

- graph neural networks adopt embedding propagation to aggregate neighborhood embedding iteratively
- By stacking the propagation layers, each node can access high-order neighbors’ information, rather than only the first-order neighbors’ as the traditional methods do

- Stage

  - Matching

    The core task of this stage is to retrieve potentially relevant items with high efficiency and attain coarse-grained modeling of user interests

  - Ranking

    The ranking model ranks these items according to the scores, and the top dozens of items are selected

  - Re-ranking

    Although the obtained item list after the ranking stage is optimized with respect to relevance, it may not meet other important requirements, such as freshness, diversity, fairness. Therefore, a re-ranking stage is necessary, which usually removes certain items or changes the order of the list to fulfill additional criteria and satisfy business needs

- Scenario

  - Social Recommendation

    Social relations are often integrated into recommender systems to enhance the final performance, which is called social recommendation

  - Sequential Recommendation

    The sequential recommendation method extracts information from these behavioral sequences and predicts the user’s next interaction item

  - Session-based Recommendation

    This motivates the problem of session-based recommendation (SBR) , which aims at predicting the next item with a given anonymous behavioral session data

  - Bundle Recommendation

    Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a combination of items for users to consume 

  - Cross-Domain Recommendation

    Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been demonstrated to be a promising method to alleviate cold start and data sparsity problems

  - Multi-behavior Recommendation

- Objective

  - Diversity
  - Explainability
  - Fairness

- Application

  - Product recommendation
  - POI (Point-of-Interest) recommendation
  - News recommendation
  - Movie recommendation
